- **Pitched project ideas**

  - Data analysis with a distributed computing framework(Spark or Flink, which are the most famous two)
  - Multi-dimensional user behaviors analysis
  - Education-website-based data
- **Tentatively decide to Spark**
  - FLink's community is not as mature as that of Spark, resulting in higher learning costs.
- **Follow ups**
  - Everyone: work on the proposal document
  - LIU Longzhi: dataset finding
  - WANG Yaodong: ideas expanding
